Project Descriptions.

You are invited to develop a facial login component of an Intelligent 
Course Management System (ICMS). The face login component may have the following 
functions.

- When a student login with his/her face, his/her information such as name, login time, and 
welcome message will be presented in the graphics user interface (GUI).
- If the student has class within one hour, the corresponding course information, classroom 
address, teacher’s message, links of Zoom, tutorial/lecture notes, other course materials and 
so on and so forth will be presented in the GUI. The student could click the links to redirect 
to Zoom or other materials. The GUI should also allow the student to send the above 
information to his/her email address by email.
- If the student does not have class at the moment, the GUI could present a personal class 
timetable for the student.
- The system should record the latest behaviour of the student, such as when he/she logins 
the system, how long the student stays in the system, etc.

Requirements. 

- Group: 1-5 students as a group.
- GUI: Each group may design GUI based on the understanding of the above user requirement 
(You could make your own design choice, because in real project, clients typically don’t know 
what they really want).
- Database: your database should have at least five tables. How to design the tables is your 
design choice.

Development Tools. 

- Face Recognition: Python + OpenCV (full codes provided.)
- GUI: Python GUI or Qt. (code not provided.)
- Database: Python + MySQL (sample codes provided.)
- Other: You can use any other Python packages if you see fit. However, the main 
programming language should be Python and the DBMS should be MySQL.

Marks (course project 20% of the final mark).

- 10% for software development. (4% GUI + 6% database)
- Other 10% for 10-minute presentation, including but not limited to development plan, 
milestones, contribution of each group member, video recording of demo, software 
design, database design (ER Diagram, tables), difficulties you encountered and how to 
solve them, etc.
- Live demo is allowed, but please make sure your program works well and stably in order 
to save time in presentation.
- Creative GUI design, creative software functions or creative DB design will have bonus 
points
